  testimonial: Jessica is currently a senior at Cypress Bay High School, serving her second term as Vice President of PAWS. She has been volunteering at Hometown Animal Hospital since her junior year, and she works to share her experiences with members, hoping to engage them in fun and educational activities that could potentially ignite a hidden passion for animals they didn't know they had, one that parallels her own. Jessica specializes in membership and has helped to recruit over 100 mebmers from all grade levels.
